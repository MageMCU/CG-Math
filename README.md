## GTE Mathematics updated 0418

The GTE Mathematics code is in a header-only library. The library excerpt 
(Mathematics folder only) was taken from the Geometric Tools Engine (GTE).
This math library is used here by MageMCU for study purposes only and 
maintained as an **archived repository**. To help facilitate the study, the 
author of GTE has written textbooks on Computer Graphics specifically on 
its application. I am presently using C++ 11.

## Geometric Tools Engine (GTE)

The Geometric Tools Engine (GTE) is a collection of source code for computing
in the fields of mathematics, geometry, graphics, image analysis and physics.
The engine is written in C++ 14 and supports high-performance computing using
CPU multithreading and general purpose GPU programming (GPGPU). Portions of
the code are described in various books as well as in PDF documents available
at the
[Geometric Tools Website](https://www.geometrictools.com). GTE is
licensed under the
[Boost Software License 1.0](https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt).
